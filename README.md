## What I Learned

This project helped me refine my Tableau design skills and focus on communicating insights visually. It also deepened my understanding of how occupation, geography, and product categories impact business performance in different ways.

## About the Project

This was a personal project to strengthen my BI storytelling skills using a real-world dataset structure. The dashboard is built to simulate how a business executive might explore and drill down into KPIs during a strategy meeting.

If you're curious or have feedback, feel free to connect or drop a message. I'm always open to learning and collaboration.
